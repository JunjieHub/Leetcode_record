# trick for two pointers

## slow and fast pointers used in linked list
- detect cycle in linked list
- return the start of cycle in linked list (Floyd's algorithm)
  - idea: first find the meeting point, then move one pointer to head, and move both pointers one step at a time, they will meet at the start of cycle
- find the middle of linked list
- find the kth element from the end of linked list
  
## two point with subarray
using need and have to check the condition, wo we don't need to repeatedly count the subarray

e.g. 
- minimum window substring

- longest substring without repeating characters
- Find All Anagrams in a String
